###Overview: 
This project comes from the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) front-end course. It's basically a search box for Wikipedia, using Wikipedia's API to search for pages based on the users input. 

This was my third project involving DOM manipulation and fetching data from 3rd party APIs. As I remember I wanted to ditch JQuery, but was intimidated by the syntax of ```xmlhttprequest```, so I stuck with what I knew.

I originally built it in [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/), then uploaded the files to GitHub.
