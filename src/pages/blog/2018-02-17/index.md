## State of the Blog

To be honest when I started building this site I didn't plan on blogging, per se, except maybe if I had an idea for something in particular. Keeping to a schedule was the farthest thing from my mind, but now I've decided to try and post every Friday. 


Of course writing regularly is supposed to be good for ones' career, and is good communication practice and all that jazz, but the real reason I made this decision is that writing the [RSS Feed post](/rss-feed-shenanigans) was really fun, and I like fun!
